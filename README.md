# Travel Assured analysis

The original [assignment](docs/Assignment.pdf) and [data file](input/travel_insurance.csv)
were provided by [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/). This project was 
originally used for my
[Professional Data Analyst certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0016698068691).
I use it now to showcase my work.


The data analysis is located in the [analysis.Rmd](analysis.Rmd) and a supporting
presentation is located in [docs/Presentation.pptx](docs/Presentation.pptx). The
output file is aimed at experienced data analysts while the presentation is
for business.
